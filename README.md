### *This README is still a WIP. Expect some things here to change or improve in the near future.*

The name is **Aizakku** (or *Aiza* for short), I'm 18 years old, Latin-American, and I strive to make my own game some day, despite spending most of my time coding for Friday Night Funkin' mods.

Also I know I have no public repositories yet, but that'll change soon I promise LMAO

## Skills
I mainly have experience using **HaxeFlixel**, but have also done some things with **GameMaker Studio 2**. I'm also trying to learn **Godot** as well.
