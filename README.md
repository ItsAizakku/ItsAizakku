## What's up ðŸ‘‹

### *This README is still a WIP. Expect some things here to change or improve in the near future.*

The name is **Aizakku** (or *Aiza* for short), I'm 17 years old, Latin-American, and while I spend most of my time coding for FNF mods, I strive to make my own game some day.

Also I know I have no public repositories yet, but that'll change soon I promise LMAO

## Skills
I have experience with both **HaxeFlixel** and **Lua**, but have also done some things with **GameMaker Studio 2**. I'm also trying to learn **Godot** as well.
